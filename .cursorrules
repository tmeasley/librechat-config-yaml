# Cursor Rules for LibreChat Configuration Repository

## Project Structure
This is the **CONFIGURATION REPOSITORY** for LibreChat Railway deployment.
- Main LibreChat code: `tmeasley/LibreChat` (separate repo)
- **Configuration repo: `tmeasley/librechat-config-yaml` (THIS REPO)**
- Railway reads config from: `librechat-env-l.yaml` in THIS repo

## Critical Deployment Workflow
**IMPORTANT**: Changes to UI/agents must be made HERE, not in main LibreChat repo!

### Correct Process:
1. Edit `librechat-env-l.yaml` in THIS repository
2. `git add librechat-env-l.yaml`
3. `git commit -m "description"`
4. `git push` → Triggers Railway auto-deployment
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
6. Refresh LibreChat web interface

### PowerShell Commands (Windows)
- Use PowerShell syntax: `Get-ChildItem`, `Copy-Item`, `Get-Location`
- Command chaining: use `;` not `&&`
- Check directory: `Get-Location` before git commands

## Configuration File: librechat-env-l.yaml

### Current Setup (Working):
- ✅ Custom app title: "Herbal Medicine AI Assistant"
- ✅ Custom footer: "Powered by Eclectic School of Herbal Medicine"
- ✅ hideModelSelection: true (shows agents instead of models)
- ✅ 4 Custom Agents defined:
  - Study Buddy (learning companion)
  - Herbie (expert consultation) 
  - Communibot (community building)
  - Diffbot (advanced analysis)
- ✅ RAG API configured: rag-api-production-f502.up.railway.app
- ✅ Vector stores for herbal curriculum
- ✅ File upload settings for documents

### Key Settings:
```yaml
interface:
  hideModelSelection: true  # CRITICAL: Shows agents not models
  appTitle: "Herbal Medicine AI Assistant"
  customFooter: "Powered by Eclectic School of Herbal Medicine"
```

## Common Issues Resolved:
1. **Wrong Repository**: Was editing main LibreChat repo instead of config repo
2. **Missing hideModelSelection**: Agents weren't showing without this setting
3. **PowerShell Syntax**: Fixed Unix command usage in Windows environment

## Railway Integration:
- Repository: `tmeasley/librechat-config-yaml`
- Config file: `librechat-env-l.yaml`
- Auto-deploy: Push to main branch triggers deployment
- URL: Railway reads from GitHub raw URL automatically

## Future Changes:
- All UI customizations go in `librechat-env-l.yaml`
- All agent modifications go in `agents:` section
- RAG API changes go in `ragApi:` section
- Interface settings go in `interface:` section
